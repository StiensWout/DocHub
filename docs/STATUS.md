## 📋 Current Architecture

### Authentication Flow
```
User → SSO Provider (via WorkOS) → /auth/callback → Session Cookie → App
     OR
User → Email/Password → WorkOS User Management → Session Cookie → App
```

### Team/Organization Structure
```
User → 1 Organization (WorkOS) → 1 Team (User's Role within Org)
Admin → All Organizations → All Teams
```

### Group/Team Sync Flow
```
User Login → Check WorkOS Organizations → Create Subgroup Teams → Assign Groups
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables (Required)
```bash
WORKOS_API_KEY=sk_...
WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=client_...
WORKOS_USE_ORGANIZATIONS=true
WORKOS_ADMIN_ORGANIZATION_NAME=admin  # Optional, default: "admin" (or use "admin" role/team)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...  # Server-side key for admin operations
```

### Admin Role Detection
Admin status can be determined by:
1. **Organization**: User in WorkOS organization named "admin" (or `WORKOS_ADMIN_ORGANIZATION_NAME`)
2. **Role/Team**: User has role/team "admin" in any WorkOS organization
3. **Database**: Fallback to `user_roles` table if not using WorkOS Organizations

See [Admin Setup Guide](../GETTING_STARTED/ADMIN_SETUP.md) for details.

### Database Schema
- `teams` table includes:
  - `workos_organization_id` - Maps to WorkOS organization
  - `parent_organization_id` - For subgroup teams
- `user_groups`, `user_roles`, `document_access_groups` - Still exist for fallback
