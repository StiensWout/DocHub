# Project Management & Tracking

This directory contains project management documentation and historical bug tracking references.

## 📋 Current Status

**Bug Tracking:** All bugs are now tracked in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/StiensWout/DLWait/issues)  
**Task Management:** Project tasks are tracked in [TODO.md](./TODO.md) and can be synced to [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/StiensWout/DLWait/projects)

## 📁 Files Overview

### Active Files

- **[TODO.md](./TODO.md)** - Comprehensive project TODO list covering features, optimizations, infrastructure improvements, and development tasks. This file serves as the source of truth for all non-bug work items.

### Historical Reference Files

- **[BUG_LIST.md](./BUG_LIST.md)** - ⚠️ **ARCHIVED** - Historical bug list. All bugs are now tracked in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/StiensWout/DLWait/issues). This file is maintained for historical reference only.

- **[BUG_REPORTS.md](./BUG_REPORTS.md)** - ⚠️ **ARCHIVED** - Historical bug reports staging area. New bug reports should be created directly as [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/StiensWout/DLWait/issues).

- **[BUG_FIX_REVIEW.md](./BUG_FIX_REVIEW.md)** - Historical bug fix validation and code review documentation. Useful for understanding past bug fixes and verification processes.

## 🔄 Current Workflow

### Bug Tracking (GitHub Issues)

1. **Report Bugs:** Create a new issue at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/StiensWout/DLWait/issues)
2. **Categorize:** Use GitHub labels (`bug`, `critical`, `high-priority`, etc.)
3. **Track Progress:** Update issue status and link to PRs when fixed
4. **Close:** Mark issues as resolved when bugs are fixed

### Task Management (GitHub Projects)

1. **Source:** Tasks are defined in [TODO.md](./TODO.md)
2. **Sync to GitHub:** Use the [GitHub Projects Sync Guide](./GITHUB_PROJECTS_SYNC.md) to create issues for tasks
3. **Organize:** Add tasks to your GitHub Project board
4. **Track:** Use GitHub Projects columns (To Do, In Progress, Done, etc.)
